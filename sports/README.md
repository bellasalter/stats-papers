This directory contains sports papers written by me, using R. The following summarize each paper in this directory: 
* [2024 NHL Playoff Simulation With Luck](https://github.com/bellasalter/stats-papers/blob/main/sports/hockeysim.pdf)
    * Using data from [Hockey Reference](https://www.hockey-reference.com/), I analyzed the effect of luck based on regular season rank on the outcomes of playoff games. I utilized Monte Carlo approach by sampling from a normal distribution to determine goals per game for each team in each matchup, factoring in my "luck" coefficient. The simulation was successful for the 2022 playoffs using season data from 2021-2022, but time will tell how effective the simulation will be for 2024.
